                    One of my favorite things to do is apply make-up wherever I go, whether it's on a different street, 
                    to school, or out. My free time is spent browsing make-up products on Lazada or Shopee.

            I have a lot of friends on my batch but this picture is one of my favorites as 
            we are complete on this picture. Due to the hectic schedule of college, we rarely have a get-together that we are complete
            so this picture really is special to me.
